Product Vision:
<p>NinerNav is FOR new and prospective UNCC students WHO want to learn more about the layout of and services on campus. NinerNav is an entertainment and educational service THAT brings the campus to life by gamifying the process of discovery. NinerNav empowers users to learn about and explore the diverse sites and locations on campus that they might not have visited yet. UNLIKE GeoGuesser, OUR PRODUCT is specifically designed around the UNCC campus, making it the perfect tool for new UNC Charlotte students who are eager to explore and get acclimated to the campus. NinerNav provides an engaging, immersive, and educational experience that turns acclimation into an adventure.</p>
